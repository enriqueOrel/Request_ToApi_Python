# Request_ToApi_Python

This is a Python module that allows you to send HTTP requests using the requests library. With this module, you can send both GET and POST requests, and retrieve the response data in JSON format.

## Installation
To use this module, you'll need to install the requests library. You can do this using pip:

Copy code: 
  `pip install requests`

## Usage
To use the requests_data function in this module, you'll need to provide the following arguments:

url: the URL of the endpoint you want to request data from
headers: any headers you want to include in the request (optional)
payload: the data you want to send in the request (optional)
responce_path: the file path where you want to save the response data (optional)
data_path: the file path where you want to retrieve the payload data (optional)
You can import the module in your Python code with the following line:

## python
Copy code:
  `from requests_module import requests_data`

Here's an example of how to use the requests_data function:

Copy code:
`url = 'https://api.example.com/data'
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'}
payload = {'query': 'search_term', 'limit': 10}
response_path = 'response.json'
requests_data(url, headers, payload, responce_path=response_path)`
This code sends a POST request to the specified URL with the provided headers and payload, and saves the response data to the response.json file.
